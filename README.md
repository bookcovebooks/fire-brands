## About This Book

A classic Western tale of two wandering cowpunchers who stumble into
trouble in the small cow town of Oreana. Sad Sontag and Swede Harrigan
arrive to bid on a ranch sale, but when they defend a young orphan
named Speck from a bullying rancher, they find themselves drawn into
something more complicated than a simple auction. As they wait for the
Bar S Ranch sale—a property lost to drink and debt—the two partners
begin to sense something suspicious about the circumstances. With its
quick-draw action, colorful characters, and the code of the Old West,
this adventure promises gunplay, mystery, and the kind of justice
that comes from standing up for what's right.
